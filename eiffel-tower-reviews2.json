After thoroughly looking around, we decided to wait a while until it became dark to see the city's lights come on. We had baguettes (ham and butter) and a beer sitting on an outside bench on the second floor and watched night fall. It was great.

Definitely the way to do it. This time it was a last minute trip so tickets were all sold out online. So we went early and waited online to get in. So here's the lesson that I learned the hard way. I went early at 8:30am to wait on line, so my 4 yr old son can sleep in. The security gate actually opens at 9, ticket booths open at 9:30am. So I went through the security line at 9, and that's my mistake. The security line is the MUCH longer line vs the ticket line. So by the time my husband and son got to the eiffel tower around 9:30, the security line was wrapped around the block, they waited online for 45mins to get in. I should've waited for them outside the security line and they can join me. It was a mistake to go inside. And you can't buy tickets unless you have your entire party. So I waited inside for my family to get thru security, so we can buy tickets together. Good thing is that I didn't have to wait on the ticket line (which was about 20-30mins - Elevator NORD side) because I had already waited on the line and the ticket agent remembered me. So, go with your family early, if you arrive by 8:30am, you shouldn't have to wait too long.","title":"Beautiful, but learn from my experience"}

The West Leg contains a lift exclusive to those that have booked the restaurant plus the stairs: the queue for the stairs was shorter but there are 780 stairs to the second level, where there's a ticket office to buy a ticket to the lifts to the top for 6 eur: everyone has to change lifts on level 2 but most will have bought a 17 eur ticket to the top at ground level. The south leg wasn't working when we were there, so not sure about the lift situation there. We went up the north leg and waited 2 hours and just as we got to the ticket office, they closed the top level due to overcrowding so could only buy an 11 eur ticket to level 2. Once at level 2 we waited another hour to buy the 6 eur ticket to the top but it was fairly quiet when we did get to the top, which helped my vertigo as, unlike last time, I didn't spend the whole time thinking the 100+ year old tower would collapse under the stupid number of people they cram in there (about 20,000 everyday!).

Needless to say the tower itself is worth a visit anyway and the views are great.

Also, please be aware that there are NO TOILETS to be found at ground level. You need to enter the tower and use them at the first level which is unacceptable.

All the 4 sides of the tower afford you with a different vista of the city .When in the past you see the tower thru travel brochures , or featured in the travel documentaries - nothing came compare or prepare you at the sight of it in person . The 4th and last way I saw the Eiffel Tower was as a backdrop from the park beside it .

Paired with a boat ride of the Seine, the Eiffel Tower makes for a quintessential Parisian experience. Security was tight when we went. We saw the police asking street vendors for paperwork, so the usual trinkets weren't offered to us as we strolled around. Expect the usual security bag search before you head up.

{"bubbleCount":50,"createdAt":"March 27, 2017","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"My boyfriend and I visited Paris this week for 4 nights and booked our tickets to visit the Eiffel Tower online. If you are wanting to go to the Tower, definitely book your tickets in advance. You print them off and present them once you are inside, which allows you to jump the queue (which is usually enormous) once you arrive at the time you have booked for. You get immediate lift access which is great; if you buy tickets there you have to take the stairs all the way up unless you buy a lift pass as well. I would recommend arriving at the Tower 30 minutes early; the queue to get in is always really large and can take a long time to get through as there is a lot of security to pass through. As a warning, you are not allowed to take any liquids e.g. a bottle of water, or heavy/sharp objects e.g. any padlock (which you may take for the bridge) or cutlery inside. The security officers will throw them away at the gates. I would definitely recommend going up all of the floors; the third floor is incredible to go up. Though taking the lift up, and the height, is scary, it is definitely worth it. I have seen some people recommend to not go to the summit/3rd floor, however I felt it was an incredible experience to go up to the top and see across the entire city. I have also seen people say not to go up at night/in the dark, however we booked the 12pm lunch picnic with access to the 1st floor, and an 8pm summit and second floor ticket, and I felt like seeing the Tower and the city lit up at night was a unique experience. It felt magical! The city is well lit up so you do not miss any great views or attractions. The tickets are not expensive online, especially for the restaurant if you go for the lunch menu. It is absolutely delicious with incredible views on the first floor whilst you dine.

So the next ticket office staff was also insisting that he should pay a child price. In the end, he only charged for me and my wife, but then swore at us as we left.

Oh, my, it was such a delight when we came up out of the metro station and knew we were close--but asked a guy to point us in the right direction.

And then as we approached, the magic continued. We arrived just before sunset. We, along with other \"newcomers\", were snapping pictures and selfies, as we continued to get closer. Then my daughter and I stopped and bought crepes and coffee, just on the other side of the Seine, still mesmerized by the sight of the Tower. The sun was going down as we got more pictures, did more gazing, when: The Lights Came ON! SO special! The Tower lit up the sky and then, at one point, it began blinking (on the hour, I think).

{"bubbleCount":50,"createdAt":"February 8, 2017","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"Paris is everything you could imagine and more. “The City of Lights” is an ideal city for a romantic excursion. Paris gives a surreal feeling and feels as if you are living a dream come true. As you stroll along the Seine and gaze at the Eiffel Tower, you have to pinch yourself to know its real life. There are many iconic sites to see that are just perfect for families, couples, or even by yourself to see. The most eminent site you should go to in Paris, France is the Eiffel Tower. The best time to go to Paris would be the summer because you don't have to worry about the cold or rain. If you go on a perfect sunny day, the view of the Eiffel Tower looks picture perfect. You should take a couple minutes looking at this masterpiece in front of you and not take the moment for granted. Just seeing it isn't enough though, you should definitely walk all the way to the top. As you take a long walk toward the Eiffel Tower to get your tickets you walk next to a beautiful long stride of green grass and find many people trying to sell you souvenirs. I highly recommend not talking or associating with those people. You have to go directly under the tower get a pass to take the the elevator up. If you are more adventurous and have more endeavor then you would want to take the stairs. At the top of the two floors of stairs you can climb, you are left with the satisfaction of having made it up 704 steps and the spectacular view ahead of you. The last floor you are unable to take the stairs and forced to take the elevator. This is now when you are heading to the very top of the Eiffel Tower. As you go up, look outside and appreciate how beautiful the city of Paris is. The architecture, buildings, landscapes, and the river all make up this absolutely gorgeous city. Standing at the very top is one of the best feelings in the world, and highly recommend it. If you are wanting lunch, you can eat at the Le Jules Verne or the 58 Tour Eiffel, these are restaurants inside of the tower but can be extremely expensive. If you can’t afford lunch in the Eiffel Tower you can eat at one of the many a local bakeries or delis nearby. Paris is a magical city full of amazing things to experience and I think one of the most exhilarating experience is the Eiffel Tower.","title":"A Day at the Eiffel Tower"}

{"bubbleCount":50,"createdAt":"February 6, 2017","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"As suggested by friends, reached Eiffel in the morning to find smaller queues for tickets to climb up the Eiffel. Took about an hour to get the tickets and get to the top. While buying the tickets, make sure which type of ticket you are buying, some take you to the top and some only till level 1-2, also check the access to lifts and stairs. If you prefer climbing up by stairs, definitely carry a bottle of water, might not easily find water inside Eiffel and definitely not cheap. The view from Eiffel is definitely breathtaking. There are parks around Eiffel where you can click pictures, relax and just enjoy the ambiance. It is not very easy to find good restaurants around Eiffel so walk up to Trocadero market for that. Also, the most accessible metro station is Trocadero. Or you can choose to hire Ferrari from Champs Elysees to Eiffel. You can also take a Siene river cruise from Eiffel which takes you around the major attractions on Siene river, usually takes an hour to start and get back to Eiffel. From the Eiffel, you can also walk up to the Triomphe de Arc. If you have ample time, dont miss to check out the twinkling Eiffel at night.","title":"A good day spent"}

Take note. If you think this will get you in quicker, think again, anyone without a reservation was turned away and forced to go to the back of the main queue. Thankfully we did have a reservation, meaning we didn't have to queue up for a second time once inside the security ring and I would recommend going online and pre booking to everyone. Having limited mobility meant my wife was not allowed to travel to the top, which in all honesty we were both quite glad off as you will not appreciate how high just the second floor of this tower is until you are riding up in the lift. The views of Paris are fantastic but even in January it is incredibly busy up there. I noticed a lot of visitors not bothering to visit the first floor however. I would advise you do call in on the first floor as it has more to it than the second such as the restaurant, and a small kiosk for soft drinks and beer.

You have a great view of the tower from there and it's ideal for taking photos with all the tower in the background. Then you can walk down the stairs and cross the road to get to the tower.

Not so easily done anymore but it's well worth the visit. For the more sporty you can walk part way up but of course you can also take the lifts/elevators.you can stop off on the first floor and second floor for lunch/tea/dinner depending on you appetite and your budget. I love to go right to the top and walk around, especially on a clear day because you can see for miles around and have fun spotting/guessing the buildings that you can see. There are garden areas to sit and rest nearby. It's a reall tourist attraction with candy, popcorn, ice-cream bars nearby, postcards a roundabout for the kids and street sellers. A definite must.

I said I understood we were the late ones, was there anything we could do. Carl - We cannot hold up a tour when you're late. I said this would not make for a good review, and that REALLY set him off. \"You're threatening me with a bad review?? Please mention my name!

We stood at the top of trocadero and was an amazing view. Afterwards we decided to walk down to the Eiffel Tower (about a 5min walk) and pay for a visit to the top floor. Was lovely at night as it was all lit up and twinkling with Christmas lights. Sadly my photos don't pick up on these. Cost me around €22.50 for myself and my son for top floor which I found very good value for money. We took the lift to the top which was rather cramped with people, although there was no space they kept pushing more people in. The view from each floor was amazing. The top outside gave a view of most of Paris and at night all the city lights are switched on giving an amazing view. Security was on high alert checking every bag and person as they entered the grounds and again when they entered the Tower so felt safe. Overall was an amazing experience and my son loved it. Just don't be roped into spending a fortune in the souvenir shop inside when there are so many men walking around outside selling Eiffel Tower key rings for one Euro and flashing light up Eiffel towers for around €5-7. You can also haggle as I bought two key rings and a large flashing one for €5. If I bought this inside prob would have paid in the region of at least €30.","title":"Amazing experience "}

There is a separate entrance for guests with reservations for your first security scan. Then, there is a separate elevator that we were able to use that brought us to the second level immediately. It was nice not to have to cue up until it was time to get the elevator to the top. With reserving a time also makes you vulnerable to weather conditions. As it turned out, it was misty ands a bit foggy at the day/time of our reservation. (We went mid November) I was disappointed thinking we would not enjoy the experience and have wasted the money to go. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the weather changes throughout the time of the visit and we were able to enjoy a less crowded day and captured beautiful photos of the tower and the views. It was s great visit. I'd also recommend downloading the Eiffel Tower app so you can enjoy the history and highlights of what your are looking at as your visit each side of the tower.

{"bubbleCount":50,"createdAt":"November 14, 2016","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"We went there twice ,once during night and once during the day can't decide what I like better. Opposite from the observation deck of trocadero gardens you can get lovely pictures. I suggest you book tickets online beforehand to get a little ahead in line. The ride to the top and again down in the elevator with glass windows to look out is exciting. View from the top is to die for whether it be day or night. View from second level is pretty much same as you would get from the summit, but again there is some thrill in going to the summit of Eiffel. If you do it fast it can take around 1.5 hours to go to summit and get back. The lift takes you to 2nd level and from here you need to change elevator to go to the summit. It can get quite windy so dress in warm clothes. Don't miss out to make a video of Eiffel twinkling every hour for a few minutes.","title":"No wonder it's the most visited monument "}

Where you used to be able to just walk up to the tower area and walk around, now the entire area is enclosed w/fencing. I could see two points of entry thru security sentries. Once inside this area you are free to walk around, take pictures, etc., etc. We got there about 5:30 on a Sunday evening and walked right in. No line what so ever. Might be different during day light hours or when the weather is warmer. It was freezing cold when we were there!. There were no lines to buy tickets and go up the tower, either. Seriously! When you get done doing whatever you went there for in the first place, you exit thru a turnstile. Meaning if you want back in, you go thru security again. I must say I felt quite safe inside this secured area. Because of the security stations, there are not mobs of people bugging you to buy their various \"goods\". However, they are all there outside the fence when you exit thru the turnstiles. I also felt safe walking back to my hotel at about 9:00 at night. It was a short walk to the Pullman Hotel and the street was very well lit, w/a few other people around. I hope you will go see this beauty if you ever get the chance!!","title":"A must see!!"}

Dress warmly (it's windy out there!), make sure you wear comfortable shoes (there is no place to sit), and use the facilities before leaving home. Bring a snack, a book and a charged mobile device, to keep you entertained! My sister and niece arrived about half an hour before opening, and all was well. Otherwise, you cannot buy tickets and wait for someone - you buy the ticket and immediately proceed to the tower. This is, I suppose, to prevent scalping, which is a good thing overall. The visit itself (not my first) is worth the wait, as the tower is a truly impressive architectural marvel. I recommend going to the very top, though it does get cold and windy up there!

You can buy lift to the varying levels which has a pretty long line OR you can walk to the first or even second observation deck and by your lift tickets from there on up to the top and shorten your wait as well as enjoy the views on the stairs. The ticket for the stairs is bought at a different booth and there is usually no wait whatsoever. When using the lifts there are commonly more than one entrance so walk around and find the shortest line :) there is a fun post office box at the base you can mail post cards from and they will be post marked \"mailed from the Eiffel Tower\".

I also saw for the first time the Statue of Liberty in Paris. I do not know if this is a duplicate or this is really the original statue.

All of Paris is laid out before you and it is quite something to see. Came down and bought a few fun trinkets at the gift shop and left. All in all, probably spent 1 1/2 to 2 hours there.

{"bubbleCount":50,"createdAt":"October 17, 2016","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"What can I add about the beauty and experience of the Eiffel Tower that hasn’t been said already? This past July was our first time visiting Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was a must on our list! It was worth the production we endured since we failed by not securing tickets in advance, which I do highly recommend. We thought we could do this in Paris once we got an idea of what our trip would be like, but you need more time – possibly a few weeks out. We woke up early and made our way towards the Tower (by Metro, which was the easiest thing to do, in spite of the slight language barrier), and arrived at the grounds around 9:00AM. The lines were just starting to form (there are a few lines you will go through, again, assuming you don’t have tickets). We went from the security/check-in line, which took about 20 minutes to get through, and then had to decide whether we wanted tickets to the second level of the tower, or tickets to ride the lift to the top, which also includes the second level. We opted for the latter. We waited in the line to purchase our lift tickets, which was about 30-45 minutes, which many people kept telling us was not that bad. (Apparently the crowds/lines and wait times in the afternoons are easily a couple of hours.) We bought our tickets, and then had to wait in another line to get on the lift. Some people opt to take the stairs, from the first to the second level, but didn’t. This was probably the fastest moving line, perhaps because it was the excitement of knowing we’d be at the top soon! We made it to the second level, took tons of pictures, and since you’re high enough, you’re able to get great panorama pics and still recognize and identify the city's monuments and architecture. We walked around it plenty, then off to the top we went! We took some awesome videos of our ride up, so I recommend doing that if you can or remember to do so. Overall, we had a great time exploring this beautiful monument and highly recommend it. After our visit, we got tickets to the water-taxi that takes you to several monuments where you’re able to get on/off, and we enjoyed that as well! The Eiffel Tower is also a stop along that route (the company name is bato bus, if I recall correctly).","title":"Not To Be Missed"}

Lunch at the restaurant capped off the visit. Leaving by Champs de Mars, you get fantastic views of the tower in the morning (sun is in the right position). There are small stalls along the path selling drinks, souvenirs, food, etc. When we arrived home, I am sure that we had over 50 photos of the tower from all angles and distances and during the day and night.

If you feel adventurous then a climb or ride to the top of the tower is next. In my opinion the best time of day to climb the tower is just about sunset. You will need to buy a combo ticket to have access all the way to the top. There is an option for a cheaper ticket just to the first level and then if you decide you want to brave it to the top you can buy a ticket at this first level, so lot's of options here. First you climb tons of stairs, definitely over 100 to get to the first observation deck, which is wide, lots of room and you get fantastic city views. But, the real fabulous view and experience is riding the elevator straight up.

I had the pleasure of seeing the Eiffel Tower during the clearest of days in addition to seeing it sparkling against the night sky. Both views of the tower were amazing, however I have to say that seeing the tower's light show at night was magical. If you want to see the city of Paris then you should go to the top of the Eiffel Tower during the daytime, but if you want to see the Eiffel Tower in of itself then you should go at night. Once you're on the second floor you will have to buy additional tickets to get to the third floor. It gets super windy on top of the Eiffel Tower which can be very cool, actually, so wear the right cloths! Also, the top of the Eiffel Tower has a little champagne bar, but what you have to remember is that this bar does not open until 12 PM so you will have to wait until that time, at least, to get some champagne while enjoying the extraordinary view of Paris.

The first time I took the stairs, and with my parents I took the West Entrance for elevators only. Both times I queued for tickets and I think the experience is worth it. It's not that bad, about 20-45 mins just like if we go to an amusement park. If you show a student card or if you are younger than 24 you get a cheaper rate otherwise it is €11 to go to the 2nd floor, which is really reasonable. They added a new ticket booth on the 2nd floor to go to the top for an additional €6 (they didn't have this before). Also, there is a new 1st floor level surrounded by glass which is pretty cool. I got lucky both times because the weather was great! Personally, I think the view from Arc de Triomphe could rival the Eiffel's view because from there you can get the Eiffel tower in your panoramic shot and it takes less time if you're in a rush.

It's very romantic, offers great views of the city and just everything I thought it would be. We went on a Tuesday evening and only waited a few minutes for security and maybe 20 minutes for tickets and the elevator ride. Going from the 2nd to 3rd floor elevator we didn't wait at all but I imagine it gets busy at times. We were there maybe 1 1/2 hours, waited for the sunset so we were able to see the city during the day and night. Once we were done we watched the Eiffel Tower light show. It happens at 9, lasts about 5 minutes and plays every hour until 1 am. ","title":"Just like you'd imagine!"}

It is best to go up the tower on a clear day, but I am happy just hanging out in viewing distance. First timers really should plan for a visit up the tower to see a panoramic view of the city, but if it is too crowded know that the views from the ground (take lots of selfies) are priceless. The best views are from the Trocadero/Palais de Chaillot and Champs de Mars Park areas. There is a lot of work currently being done in the Trocadero area so it isn't as nice to hang out here as it has been in the past.

However many are put off going up when they arrive and see the queues of up to 3 hours. However there is a secret I have been taught that I wish to pass on. When you get to the tower, from the River [Seine] side, go to the rear right foot of the tower. This is where the ticket office is to walk up the tower. The queue is quick and it takes 15-20 minutes if you go slow to reach the first level. You don't need to be particularly fit as there were some elderly ladies (60+) walking just behind us. From there you can walk to the second level (which is what my family did) or catch a lift to the third level. From the second level you have no option but to catch a lift to the third level and tickets can be purchased for this up the tower. The biggest challenge with the Eiffel Tower is making it up to the first level, as clearly once up the tower people spend differing amounts of time at each stage, this thins out the traffic and makes each quicker. Hope this helps.","title":"Want quick access up the tower? Here is how."}

The first queue was the outer security barrier and airport security. I had my backpack searched, once inside we had to locate the ticket office. Stood waiting for a ticket for about half an hour with a group of Turkish men who spoke good English, amid regular army security patrols. Got to the ticket office and paid for two full tickets for ‘Sommet’. Found our way to the first stage lift and had to wait in a hot room inside the leg of the tower for the lift while some actor who you could not hear gave a brief history talk about the tower in English. Got into the cramped lift as the people packed themselves into every possible space, and nervously watching the lift weight meter.","title":"Got an eye full"}

As a family traveling with a stroller, the mass of people near the Tower was a bit stressful - primarily on the sidewalks. But.. here are limited-access fenced off areas all around the tower that are very park-like, so we found a great location to relax under a tree and enjoy the view. You can also go in under the tower once you pass through a long security line. The Eiffel Tower is more impressive in person than any photo and was well worth the visit... And if I thought it was impressive during the day, it was even more stunning at night. Just beautiful!! If you want to go up in the tower, you need to make reservations several weeks or more in advance (or risk waiting in the extremely long line and take your chances). The reservation allows you to by-pass the long security line for a much shorter one. Being under the tower was ahead experience as well.We went to the second floor level at night and then from there were able to get tickets to the top from there.

It is such a beautiful and short walk! If you want to go up the tower it will give you a beautiful view of Paris. I don't like heights, so I probably won't be doing that very often. When I do go I try to go at night not too long before it closes. The nighttime views are beautiful and the lines tend to dwindle down then and not be so bad.

I am now not myself, I have to become ignorant. I get down one level, but still cannot get to the bottom. I have to search for way down, Anxiety plus.

We arrived at the Eiffel around 6pm. The lines ups were about an hour for the elevator so we decided to take the stairs at the south or sud entrance. This line was about 30 minutes long and cost 7€. You can also skip the line by either making a reservation at the Jules Verne restaurant or pre-purchasing a ticket online reserved for a particular time. There were 320 steps to the first level. You can go at your own pace and stop as often as you like to enjoy the view along the way. The first level has some informative displays, a snack shop, gift shop and Restaurant 58 and of course some great views of Paris. After viewing from this level you can purchase an add on ticket to ride and elevator to the second level or continue up the stairs with no extra charge. The views are similar to the first level and there are a few more shops and snack bars. The final ascent to the top is by elevator only and you can purchase an add on ticket to ride the elevator. I didn't continue to the top because even at 7:30pm the line ups were still horrendous. Some people have said they prefer the views from floor 1 and 2 because from the top, things are too far away to appreciate. We rode the elevator down for free but you could take the stairs down if you choose to. Be sure to come back when it's dark to view the tower all lit up and flashing on the hour.

The tour guide warned us of the pickpockets everywhere - on which Paris authorities haven't really cracked down. These people (small foreign-looking women, a lot of them) ask if you speak English, and try to get you read/write something to help them, but it's a distraction while someone else picks your pocket. Thankfully, we avoided this because our guide pointed it out, but we saw all kinds of them \"working\" the crowds after that! There were also pushy trinket vendors everywhere selling things - just soliciting tourists over and over. The worst aspect was that the whole grounds badly needed a cleaning - there was litter all around the Eiffel Tower - such a shame in such a remarkable city.

It didn't seem real at first. It was bigger than I imagined. You have to keep tipping up your head to see the top. It was overcast this first time. When we arrived back in Paris after our bus tour of France we spent around 2 hours at the Eiffel Tower. We had purchased advanced tickets so good go right to that line. We had maybe a 10 minute wait. This was at 10am. Security checks (2) and then you get into the elevator. Cool experience of rising over the skyline of Paris. This was still a little overcast but bright. We walked around the tower and level one. Took many pictures. We then climbed up the stairs to level 2. Walked around there and then decided to walk down the stairs to the bottom. We saw some youth who had just walked all the way up from the ground they looked cooked. I was glad we were walking down. Maybe took us 20 minutes. Not bad at all. You get a very look at all the innards of the Tower. rivets, pulleys, etc. When we got down to the ground level we walked away from tower to get some more photos. We walked towards the grassy field towards the main part of town. We took some selfies along with many others doing the same.

I was there with my mum this last 14 July and given her age I opted for renting an apartment two blocks away from Eiffel Tower. We easily walked to the Eiffel tower around the time of fireworks and not worrying about need to catch metro after the fireworks show. If you can't afford to stay close to Eiffel tower I will strongly suggest to get your place in the park in front of Eiffel tower (Champs de mars) by 8 pm on July 14. The place get overly packed by the time fireworks start and it will be almost impossible to get a decent spot. Also, the view is best from the Champs de mars side of the Eiffel tower. Try to avoid the bridges or spending money at the river cruises which may sound romantic but you will not get the best views. To go back take the metro from La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle to get to your destination. To avoid crowds you may leave 5 minutes earlier than the total fireworks duration which is around 35 minutes.

One thing that was a must is purchasing the tickets online which allowed us to skip the really long queue and almost go straight in (we had to go through security). The trip up was easy to the second level but going to the third level had a long line when we first got there at around 5:45 PM. Instead, we went back down to the first level to see if we could eat in the restaurant since we hadn't eaten all day, and even though we didn't have a reservation, they were able to seat us. This was at 6 PM and they had just opened. Dinner was really good, if a bit expensive (but you can't beat the view!). Afterward, we went back up and there was no longer a line, so we went to the third level. I had heard that the third level wasn't worth it but I thought it was pretty fantastic. You could see forever. All in all we felt it was worth the money and time and enjoyed it completely. On a side note, they had a giant soccer ball hanging in the middle of the tower for the Euro tournament that was going on. Also, if you do the Eiffel Tower in the evening just before sunset and then finish it off with a river cruise (right down from the tower to the river), take the last river tour available in summer (10:30 PM I believe) then you get to see Paris at night and the Eiffel Tower all lit up.

{"bubbleCount":50,"createdAt":"July 15, 2016","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"I'm not going to sugarcoat this: I was terrified that I'd have to go find the American embassy and I didn't have my passport on me. My fears that France would be victim to a terrorist attack on 14 Juillet were sadly justified in Nice, but not in Paris. France is clearly in a state of emergency; Police with big GUNS were EVERYWHERE. To get near the Eiffel Tower, they searched bags and patted you down. My partner thinks they didn't do s great job of it, as they failed to pat down his pockets. Nonetheless, the French policewoman patted me down thoroughly. Policemen patrolled in packs throughout the property. I felt safe. On to more fun topics, the classical concert before the fireworks was magnificent!!! The best France has to offer was on display. The fireworks show was stunning. It started out more delicate than American audiences are used to, and ended with a jaw dropping bombastic display. If you go next year, arrive early to scope out a place. If we're here next year, I think we'll stay by the riverfront. So many people came out, and what a party! So many drunk people (like help your buddy stay on his feet kinda drink). We walked a ways to get away from the hoard of people and had a snack before hopping on the metro. It was very quiet then. I imagine those who drove had quite the long commute home. Traffic was very backed up. Overall, not a show to miss. Live your life without fear of terrorism. If you're too scared to even show up, then they win. But maybe have ID on you just in case you need to get into your country's embassy.","title":"14 Juillet Celebration was AWESOME!!"}

A private elevator took us to the restaurant on the second floor. Make sure you book your reservation at least 3 months in advance. It was much easier to get a Monday night, Saturday night was sold out. From our table, it was clear to see why Paris is called the City of Lights. It was a 5 Star meal with a breathtaking view. Also, the Eiffel Tower is lit up and the lights flash at night too.This restaurant is All about the Presentation.I had never used a fork and knife that were long and narrow. You were allowed to walk around and take in the view between courses. The Sommelier paired the wines to accommodate our taste. All the wines were 100% from France.We received quite a wonderful lesson throughout our 3 hour meal. My husband chose the 6 course meal and I chose the 5 course meal.We chose the 6 wine pairings. This was our Anniversary and therefore we were extravagant. This meal was more than 500 Euro, but the price for the location--The Eiffel Tower!!! and the savory meal, attention to details like the J in the butter,the presentation of Each Course all were well worth the price. You have the choice to select fish or meat. This memory will be with us for a lifetime.

As this was my second visit, I was able to compare this experience with that of the one way back in 1998. I must say that I am a little disappointed. My wife was a first time visitor on this occasion so she enjoyed the Eiffel Tower. I found the area around the tower crowded and dirty (lots of broken glass and people selling beer in buckets; Euro 2016 fever). The beautiful lawns on which one could picnic in the past was barricaded to form a fan park. Security to get to the base of the tower was tight and detracted from the experience a bit (but I understand the necessity for it). But tickets online beforehand or face standing in long lines. The journey to the summit via the second level was awesome. You see the city of Paris unfold before your eyes. The summit (and second floor) allows for great views out across the city and one is able to get some great pics from the high vantage point. Unless you intend having a meal at one of the restaurants or to have a look in the very small and crowded souvenir shop(s), there is not much else to do. Buying and enjoying champagne at the summit was available though.

Both times were nice but I have a few tips to make you life a little better. The first time we went during a busy afternoon. It was a gorgeous brisk day and the sun was out. There was a african dance festival going on nearby and you could hear the drums over the violinist by us. We ended up buying food there and finding a spot on a grassy area on the south side. It was perfect. I would definitely recommend stopping at a Monoprix or any other grocery store and buying something there SO much cheaper that way! Also they say no wine, bring it, no one will say anything to you. There were people popping wine and champagne all around us and the cops there didn't say a thing. When you get there and leave be careful to not get trapped in the tourist areas. When walking through DON'T make eye contact or they will follow you. Also watch your things because people will try to scan your bag or pickpocket you. We avoided all of those areas but one time and severely regretted it walking through it. The second was in the evening and it was GORGEOUS! It was well worth it and actually less tourists and more locals were there. People exercising, hanging out with friends, walking their dogs, it was really nice. There were a lot of guys trying to sell bottles of wine and champagne to the few tourists out there, don't buy them. They were charging $30 a bottle for a $4 bottle of wine. We left going the way of the military museum which I believe is on the north side. It was a wonderful walk. Well worth the visits. It really is a beautiful structure.

She would speak a couple words in French, then walk away to let her colleague explain in English, then come back and explain some more, and this went on for three rounds.

I don't know if they still allow it now though for security reasons. It can be seen best at the trocadero or from the garden on champ Mars. You have to visit it in the morning and in the evening. At sunset, they turn on the lights (around 9 pm) and wait for the start of the hour. During the first 10 minutes of every hour, the lights on the Eiffel Tower sparkle with blinking lights. Like a fairies sprinkling pixie dust (as my daughters friend describes it) if you are in the gardens beside the tower, you can sit on the grass gazing at the tower eating food and drinking wine or beer which are being sold by several vendors walking around.

She preferred making jokes more than focusing on the tour. She told us we could skip her talk about the sights from the second level and go directly to the top. We decided to listen to her talk since we had paid A LOT of extra money for the tour and the skip the line tickets. It was completely not worth it. Although the guide told us we could listen to her talk and still have time to go to the top she was wrong. For some reason the workers at the Eiffel Tower decided to stop going to the top at 2200 instead of 2300. We learned while we visited that French workers sort of make up their own work rules. The Eiffel Tower workers had a one day strike the day before to support others who were striking. Also France was playing in the European Cup. However our guide did not wait to make sure we were able to go to the top so we missed out. We understand part of our group made a big fuss with a lift operator who unlocked and took them up.

We paid 17$ Euro to go to the top, the line was short, the wait to get up was minimal and everything was smooth and efficient. If you are not on a strict budget and don't have a fear of heights, spring the extra money to go to the top as opposed to the 2nd floor - though you can get a good view from the 2nd floor, the top is much more of an experience. Part of it is enclosed so on a cold or rainy night you can stay there, but there are also stairs to go up one more level where you are outside really experiencing Paris in all its glory. Some people don't realize there is the option, so even on a rainy day you can go up (though the raindrops on the window will show on your pictures in the enclosed area).

Or people avoiding due to the football, but I wouldn't be put off going to the tower because of the football. However I expect it's a different experience. Non tower ticket holders like us couldn't get to wander round the gardens and the base of the tower because it was sealed off with railings to allow a) tower visitors not to have to mix with football fans and b) for the police/ security to allow fans into the fan zone to watch the football on the big screen via security checks in a controlled manner. We were still able to get photos of us close to the tower. I also went in the fanzone ( female with teenage daughter).

We arrived there 10 minutes early and went right to the area which was obviously marked for tickets with reservations. We began right on time -and went to the 2nd floor- enjoyed the view for 20 minutes and then decided to purchase tickets to the Summit. There is an auto purchase kiosk that is very fast and easy (6.50 Euros). There was hardly anyone in line and we went straight to the top. Even decided to sip on champagne while we were there. The 2nd floor does have spectacular views-even though it was cloudy -it was still amazing. But if you are there -you really do need to go to the summit.

This allowed us to purchase tickets to visit the Summit, which is the highest point on the Tower that you can visit. SO GLAD that we bought these in advance online, since Summit tickets sold out in advance and could not be purchased day of our visit. When you purchase in advance, you select a day and time for your visit, so be certain that you can actually be there on your appointed day and time. Go to the entrances marked with green flags, indicating admission for those with advance tickets. You will walk past long lines of people who are attempting to buy day-of tickets, and you will avoid having to wait in those long lines!!! Beware of pick pockets on the elevators (signs are even posted!!). Be ready to take stunning pictures. From the Summit, you can purchase a glass of champagne, so if this visit is a landmark, bucket list event for you, splurge on the champagne. We went to the Summit first, and then down to the second level, then to the ground. We did not stop on the first level, as it appears that getting from the first level down to the ground by elevator is a very long wait, always.

I had read that there is often an ice skating rink on level 1 in winter and much to our 10 year old's delight it was true! Our kids (10, 14 and 16) skated and enjoyed hot chocolate while we watched and had a glass of wine. It was a wonderful afternoon. In fact we spent around 5 hours in total just enjoying the eiffel Tower and the fact it was New Years Eve. A fabulous first experience in Paris for our children.","title":"Fabulous way to spendNew Years Eve"}

It was fun. She led us through the lines, security (you are allowed cameras), and looked after us for the hour and a half tour before leaving us to our own devices. It took us up to the 2nd floor (you can add on trips in the lift to the top), which for us was fine with great views over Paris and good photo opportunities.

{"bubbleCount":40,"createdAt":"June 1, 2016","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"When you're in Paris, you have to see the Eiffel Tower, right? We forgot to book tickets online and the next available date was weeks after the end of our trip. So we stood in line to climb up to the 2nd floor and I was crossing my fingers we'd be able to still somehow get to the top (we were, but more on that later) The line to take the elevator up was so terribly long so we waited in the shorter, but still very long line to climb the staircase. I really hate to give this 4 stars only since the structure itself is mind-blowing. It's absolutely gargantuan which you really can't understand just looking at pictures and its quite a bit more beautiful in person too - In photos, it looks like a dull, boring gray color but it's actually a gleaming light brownish-gray with names etched into a little part on the backside (I think they're the names of builders who helped with the tower but I'm not sure) of the tower. I also had no idea how the Eiffel Tower came about but it was the winning design for a contest to construct a structure with certain dimensions and the winner of course, was Mr. Eiffel! The climb to just the 1st floor wasn't easy - I think since it was toward the end of the trip, my legs were just ready to be done - and the continuing climb to the 2nd floor was even more difficult, but at both floors, there's plenty of room to sit and leisurely walk around and get food. This honestly made me a bit sad since the cafes and gift shops are magnets for tourists but of course, it's all clever tourist accommodations. Now onto the lesser impressive parts. All around the tower are hawkers trying to sell their little trinkets for 1-5 euros and you'll hear the same pitch over and over again which was exhausting and obnoxious. They're not always nice when you say no. In fact, once you leave the Eiffel Tower, they're gathered around the exit area waiting for people to come out and you literally have to maneuver around them since they're grouped together. Even if you're relaxing on the grassy area behind the tower, they'll come over to you and offer beer/wine for a few euros and you'll hear that pitch at least a dozen times. Just shake your head or say no and repeat as necessary. Another thing I wasn't crazy about was the line at the 2nd floor to get tickets to take the elevator to the very top. Since they had to wait for people to come down before allowing the rest of us up, we had to wait about 30 minutes for the tickets to be available and there was little respect for the line. People were cutting in and pretending they had always been in line and it was annoying to say the least. Finally, the elevator ride up was actually pretty fun since it goes up at an angle and the top was scary high but the view itself was not absolutely incredible. It was beautiful yes, but it honestly could have been any major city if it weren't for the old structures. Also if you go up to the very top, make sure you have a scarf and/or jacket because it's cold! The weather that day was in the 70's but it's chilly and windy when you're up that high. I would have regretted not seeing the Eiffel Tower but be prepared for the little nuances that put a damper on seeing the tower itself.","title":"Very impressive structure but not worth all the hype"}

I'll never forget driving into Paris and seeing it in the background. My husband poo-poohed me and said it couldn't be. We stopped our car, and I accosted a gentleman on the street. He confomred with a wry smile that it was, indeed, La Tour Eiffel. Three years ago I brought my grandsons to Paris and went online to reserve places on the elevator for the last time available on Friday night. We were to leave Paris the next morning. It was one of the highlights of the trip. The lights were on up and down the tower and across Paris's bridges. While we grownups sat at one of the tables mid-way up, the boys ran up and down, oohing and aahing. We forgot that the Metro closed at midnight (or before?) but we were lucky enough to find an SUV taxi that could return the six of us back to the Marais.

It is situated on the 7th arrondissement of Paris near Champ de Mars (戰神廣場). It is also on the riverside of the Seine (塞納河). Its construction started on January 28, 1887 and was completed at the end of March 1889. It was originally built for the 1889 World's Fair and was not intended to be permanent. It took only 2 years and 2 months with 300 workers, 18,038 pieces of wrought iron and 2.5 million rivets to build the Eiffel Tower. It must have been very hard to build such a massive architecture in such a short period even with today's technology. Eiffel Tower is 324 m (1,063 ft) tall and is the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 m (410 ft) on each side.

That is, unless you can afford the Jules Verne....in which case you are probably not looking on Trip Advisor for your vacation plans! I'm sure your personal assistant handles that for you. But for the other 98%, do yourself a favor and splurge on the Restaurant 58 lunch or even better, dinner. It is about $100/adult but WELL worth it! You will have a fabulous meal....really! Plus the incredible views from literally inside the Eiffel Tower (which is why, by night, it is much better). Be careful about the time of year you go.....because if a night-lights view is what you are after, you will have to choose the late seating.

And they are going as fast as they can at the ticket offices - it's not inefficiency but just an over popular monument. But you gotta see it! And go up it, to get an idea of how Paris is laid out, before you start your wanderings down side streets or trips to other Museums. The Tower lights up on the hour every hour when it's dark.

So that you stay in another queue at the second floor to buy a ticket for the top instead of enjoying yourself at the second floor. What happens at the second queue at the second floor? You wait 45 minutes because the tickets desk happens to be closed, solely on a random basis. After the wait they tell you you can't pay with your credit card, only cash! Only after you argue with them they reveal the hidden POS and you finally get your ticket to stand in another queue to get up to the top. Needless to say, if you want to go back down, there are new queues! Does the elevator take you directly down?

I booked my ticket for 11am, however, as I was there early, I decided to try and go up early, but they wouldn't let you through until 5 minutes before the time on your ticket. Once that time came though, they let you straight through to the queue to go up the tower. I didn't have to wait long in the line for the lift to go up the tower. The lifts are roomy, and fit a lot of people in. The lift took us up to about half way, then we got out, had a look around at the lovely views, and had to queue up again to get another lift to the summit. This queue took a little longer - a good 30 minutes, and it was very windy! Well worth it though as the views at the summit are even more spectacular. When I came back down, the lift stopped at another floor not very far from the bottom. This floor had a glass floor, along with a restaurant. I decided to get off at this floor and have a look at the glass floor - it was pretty amazing, but my legs did feel a bit jelly like when I stood on it! I also went for a meal at the restaurant, which has ample seating, friendly staff and beautiful views. I could have got the lift down, but as it wasn't a particularly long way down, I decided to walk down the Eiffel Tower using the stairs after I had finished my meal at the restaurant. (By the way, there is more than one food outlet on the tower, as well as gift shops). The stairs felt very safe and weren't steep at all. It didn't take more than 5 minutes to walk down. I had a lovely day at the Eiffel Tower, and would highly recommend this attraction. The only thing I would strongly advise is that you book your tickets in advance online before coming.

Lunch at Eiffel 58 was very well done, even though we were a small group on the tour, each lot of couples were given individual tables for 2, which was nice! Great views were had, the food was well done considering the number of people they would have to get through in a lunch break. Food and drinks were included in this package. We had time for a quick walk around the first floor taking in the views. Be aware you have to allow time for travelling up and down the lifts as there are line ups and limited numbers can be taken at a time. Anyway we arrived at the but to take us to the Palace of Versailles in time. We had the top open on the bus which was nice. My husband wasn't so sure this was a necessary attraction to see prior to leaving but everybody who had been there insisted it was worth seeing! We both agree it was! The opulence was extreme and could easily see why there was The French Revolution. Having said that years on and we have this Palace and it's grounds left for the generations to visit. One could not have expected to see something this extreme! Be warned that the crowds are big and congestion in some rooms can occur. Unfortunately we were given audios without the earphones.

There is no charge to walk the grounds where the Eiffel Tower is located, but a fee for the elevator to ascend.

As crazy as my experience was (I'll get into that a little later) I highly recommend it. My husband and I visited the tower SEVERAL times through out our visit in Paris. We went during the day (without going up) and walked around the grounds, to the park etc... It was fun. We went at night on a separate day (without going up) to enjoy the light show. That was the best! We walked the bridge and got a view from there which was bliss! Then walked up close and waited for another light show (every hour for only 5 minutes). On our LAST day we finally went UP the tower. We went at 4pm so that we can see the sunset and get pictures of day views and night views. I LOVED IT! We spent 4 hours in the tower. The queue wasn't too long, we probably waited 30min to get our tickets then 20min from Security to the 2nd floor of the tower. I recommend getting off at the 2nd floor and going down to the 1st floor to get views of the glass bottom floor then making your way up back to the 2nd floor to get up to the summit. The Summit was WINDY but amazing. The queue to get up to the summit wasn't too bad we waited maybe 20min. A WARNING MY HUSBAND WAS PICK POCKETED SOMEONE STOLE HIS CELLPHONE at the summit! With CLEAR Signs EVERYWHERE and announcements my husband didn't pay attention put his guard down and placed his phone in his side coat pocket. My husband has a smart watch and the smart watch alerted him that the phone was more then 30feet away that's how he realized he was pick pocketed. We spoke to someone who was working in the tower and they acted as if they weren't sure of the procedure. They seem as if they cared and was sorry but they didn't really help us nor do I think they could have. Well that was that we realized we were victims of A PARIS THIEF (stupid tourists). We continued with our plans, saw the sunset got amazing shots of Paris at night. Witnessed the light show in the tower and bought souvenirs in the gift shop. It was all so magical and romantic. Yes it is expensive and yes you will wait in lines but its a tourist attraction what else do you expect! Just an FYI DO NOT put your guard down, watch your surroundings at all times!!!

We booked our tickets 3 months in advance, and we recommend one do the same to be able to avail all the time slots. Get your tickets online to avoid the lines on the day of your visit, as online tickets give you direct entry, it is essential to carry a photo id proof, just in case you need to present it. We chose the last slot, 2130 hrs, this is the last slot during summers, the ticket was valid to the summit, and costs 17 euros each. We took the Metro 4 and changed onto Metro 6 from Gare Montparnasse to Bir Hakeim. One can also use RER C and get off at Champ -de- Mars, which is the closest to Tour Eiffel entrance, keep in mind this is a 10 - 15 min walk, thus you should get to this spot atleast 20 mins before your tour timing. The tour is fairly easy with elevators to assist you to all levels, you could take the steps to levels one and two. The lines to use the elevators can take some time, hence it is advisable to keep 2 hours minimum for the visit. We advise a visit in the night as the view from the tower is spectacular, the tower also twinkles every hour on the hour for 5 minutes, nightfall onwards, until 1 am. This sight is enjoyed from the Jardins du Trocadero right opposite the tower. There is a restaurant on the first floor, with the full first floor having a transparent floor, and a champagne bar on the top floor, open until 10 pm.

The Eiffel is more beautiful and grand in person than it is in any picture or video. Our hotel (Le Derby Alma) was 5 minutes away from the Eiffel, so every night after dinner, we would sit on the lawn and wait for the lights to come on. It's like magic! The lights start twinkling by the hour till 10pm or even later in the summer time. We also took a tour of the underground hydraulic system thru Viator, and it gave us a look of the underground basements bunkers of the Eiffel, the tour also gave us access to the upper floors and to the very top. The view is spectacular, you can pretty see all of the City of Paris including the river Seine. The tour is highly recommended. However, if you don't want to spend the money on the tour, then buy a bring a drink and chill by the lawn to wait for the twinkling lights of the Eiffels to light up.

One really cool thing to do with your smartphone: fast motion of the elevator ride to/from the 3rd floor - looks really cool in Instagram. During the Holidays, we got to ice skate in the 1st floor.

My boyfriend and I were in Paris, in May 2015, and the weather was perfect. One day, we decided to take a water taxi that stopped at all the biggest tourist spots in Paris. The Eiffel Tower looms above the city skyline and your view is excellent from the water, especially at night. The biggest turn off was hearing that 3 days prior to our visit, The Eiffel Tower was shut down for a couple of days. The local newspaper said that the Eiffel Tower workers went on a pseudo strike for a couple of days because the pick pocketers were barraging the Tower grounds in force.

They don't tell you, but that is not what they want you to do.

Although we were disappointed the observation was amazing. The tower is brilliantly lit up and changes from sparkles to blue to yellow to red with the star light at the top. It is very memorable. We returned that night to our room and then in the morning caught a subway back but unfortunately it was a hazy morning and it would have been uneventful to take the elevator to the top - unless of course you wanted to look at clouds. As we were leaving for Brussels in a few hours by high speed train we returned to our room and packed for our trip. The walk that evening even though we wer told it was only 1 hour away, took us through many sites such as the Cathedral (Notre Dame), the bridge with all the love locks, we even watched a movie being filmed along the canal. I would suggest taking a canal boat as it also goes through the city and past all the sites we saw. We enjoyed a Paris Cafe' before we left and watched a parked car leave its parking spot ( I say this as the cars are parked bumper to bumper- literally) and was curious as to how they parked or left when ready to go - well they go forward and backward, forward and backward and in this particular case he could not get out so he backed up to the car behind, then pushed it backward into the next car and the next car until he had enough steering room to leave - wow! We walked the streets a bit, visited a couple of place and then continued on our journey. I found the people in Paris to be rude. We were rather confused at the train station and people would walk by without concern. Finally a nice young man who was from Iraq, asked if he could help and literally walked us 1/4 of a mile in the train station to the exit we had to take.

As expected it was crowded and costly but we loved it... seeing so many people of different nationality, food stalls offering variety of cuisines, playing music, it was like one big party at the same place contrast that to seeing almost no one in winters. It was exceptionally hot on the first day (global warming may be)... but later two days it rained so the temperature came down with cool breeze whole day. We really enjoyed getting drenched in the rain near Eiffel. As expected there were 1 - 1.5 hours line for ticket and another 1 - 1.5 line to go up. We did not go up due to one more reason as we had seen the Paris skyline from Sacre-Coeur and sadly did not like it. Paris is huge and beautiful but very little trees. We came back in evening to get a selfie from Palais de Chaillot with Eiffel in the background. It is lit with fantastic lights in the evening. Overall a very lovely experience.","title":"Wonderful Experience!!!"}

To get there, take the yellow line to Champ de Mars - Tour Eiffel station. Or the green line to Bir Hakeim station. The Tower is only a 10min walk from these stations. Buy your tickets online to avoid horrendous lines. If you book online (stair entrance tickets are not sold online) and still end up queuing for the elevator, take the stairs. It's not far, and more time for photos. Don't do this if you're scared of heights, because the stairs are exposed to the elements with only chicken wire enclosing them, so completely see through. Make sure you buy 3rd floor tickets, though that floor is subject to weather conditions. Don't take large bags! Invest in RFID protective sleeves for your credit cards, and DON'T TAKE ANY CASH WITH YOU. You can pay for everything you buy on the Tower using credit/debit cards. Thieves are EVERYWHERE on the Tower, so hang on to your things like your life depends on it!!!! Nighttime is usually less crowded, and magical because it's all lit up.

The stair ascent between the 1st and 2nd level felt scarier to me...it seemed to be extra steep and all you can see is beams and high places..not for those afraid of heights. By the time I made it to the midlevel at 600 ft I was content to stay there and the views were perfect. My family rode the lift to the summit and said that the views were terrific as well. It does cost extra to go to the summit and you can buy a ticket from the midlevel if you don't want to decide until part way up. The bonus of going after dark is seeing the tower dancing with lights.

At an average cost of $75 this is an option. At $25 however I found it impossible to bypass the official Eiffel Tower website.

Arriving by bateau bus - highly recommended! - our first glimpse of the Tower from the river was wonderful. We queued for just over an hour to go in - and yes, security is more evident, but strangely comforting, with armed soldiers patrolling the area and airport style xray machines for bags and walk-through metal alarms at the entrance - but once you are through and actually inside the frame itself, it is thrilling and enchanting. The lift clanks and clatters upwards, revealing spectacular views of the city below. You are brought to the 2nd Floor, with incredible views, and can buy tickets there to the summit - definitely worth doing, even for someone like me, who's terrified of heights! Up there, have a glass of champagne from the little 'shop' and gaze across the city laid out below. It's a fantastic experience - a great way to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary ;-). There are shops, cafés and toilets on 2nd floor so don't be worried about being caught short, so to speak.

Getting out on the 2nd floor means another lift to the summit (and another queue) but again not too bad. Once at the top we were greeted with a view that millions have seen but it doesn't take anything away from how special this is.

But if you show up when it's crowded, which could be anytime during good weather, and sometimes during bad, you can wait in line for hours. But for about $45 per person, you can buy a 'skip the line' ticket, which puts you on level two in about 15 minutes, with an additional 30 minutes or so to get on the center elevator to the top. 'Skip the line' is actually a service where you meet a guide at a designated spot, then have them lead you past the throng and through security, and finally to the base elevator dedicated for this process.

On a spur of a moment, my spouse and I decided to go up to the summit. We saw a short queue at the ticket booth and the lady at information counter said it was not a busy day. The ground counter only allows you to buy tickets up to second floor. When we reached the second floor. The ticket booth for summit was closed and no one tells you whether it will or what time it opens again. It appears if the summit is too full of people, they close the booth. We decided to queue and soon a long queue was behind us. After 1.5 hours, the booth opened and we bought our tickets. There's toilets on second floor but always a long queue. There's also a long queue to the lifts to take you to the summit. When in the lifts, look up and take a photo shot of the steel structure - it's an amazing structure. At the summit, there's also toilets but no queues when I visited. If weather is cold, do wear warm clothes as the wind is a pretty strong on the second floor while queuing for tickets and if you want to stay outdoors longer on the summit, you need warm clothes. There are queues for the lifts going down too. You could buy tickets online to avoid queues but we decided not to as we wanted to go with the flow.

There are 4 sections, we went on the south side where we walked up the steps: there are 360 steps to level 1 and 360 steps to level 2; that's as high as you can go. You can go up by elevator, but the lines for that are very long, and the elevator is crowded. You can go down by elevator however, without a fee. There is an expensive restaurant on the first level, you need a reservation. I was pleased to find that the passageway up the steps was wide enough to permit faster climbers to ascend without being stuck behind me, and there was an exhibit of how the tower was built on every platform, so you could rest and read the exhibit if you wanted. The view of the city was, of course, amazing. There are places to sit and souvenir shops on each level. It was a great experience.

The lines can be quite lengthy and we bought the skip-the-line tours from City Wonders (also well worth it especially for the interesting history behind the tower and its creator), but later on in the evening the queues do thin out. Interesting to view Gustav Eiffels apartment at the summit - the very thing that eventually resulted in this structure remaining and not being dismantled at the end of its contractual life after the World Fair. Warning, do not take cans or glass bottles in your bags as you go through security and they will remove either of those items and you will lose them. (Some people have thrown them off - hence the ban). Well worth the visit to this icon. In the evenings, the tower flickers on the hour every hour for about the first 10 minutes - a sight to behold.

Standing underneath the ET is absolutely sublime; it stands in perfect symmetry in the middle of the sky alone. Standing on line to get in feels stupidly touristic, but once you start the climb you forget all those around you and the thrill of such a feat motivates your feet to climb. And a climb it is! The views from the 1st and 2nd levels are absolutely stunning. But my favorite part and definitely scary is how you can stand on glass platforms that look down to the ground. I had to have some tourists coach me to take the walk on the platforms and the experience is certainly one that should be on a bucket list. As is seeing the Eiffel Tower all lit up and sparkly at night. I can understand going to Paris and not actually visiting the ET, because just to see it from afar is a lucky and romantic treat, but now that I've done it -- I can't believe that I've never done it before.

The evening tour times were all taken so if that is your objective, book way early depending on the month you want to visit. That being said, one still has to wait in a bit of some lines but all in all far less than if you don't have tickets for a specific time slot.

So instead we walked around and read up about the history and took in the enormity of the structure. We walked away taking lots of photos. I have been before and we didn't have to wait as long to get tickets. However this was the end of the summer season so very busy.

My tips would be to buy priority tickets or tickets in advance because the queues are extremely long to climb it, around a 45 minute wait, and it was during the beginning of October when I went.. 3 hours roughly waiting time in the summer. There is a lift that will take you up the Eiffel Tower which is good. There is a souvenir shop but the prices are ridiculously expensive, and you can get the same items for cheaper elsewhere. The views are spectacular, even if you don't go right to the top. Very picturesque. Also they have a new part on one of the levels were there is a section of glass which you can stand on and see the people walk underneath, it is pretty cool. The staff can speak English , and there are signs etc with English on them too. Every night at 9pm it lights up and sparkles for around 5 minutes which is lovely to see. There is also a light coming from it which shines around Paris. I wish there was more about why the tower was built and the history behind it, though.

But heed all the Rick Steeve's warnings and pre-book your ticket. The line with a prepaid is still long, but substantially less than those trying to buy same day. I was there in March, and many dates and times were sold out a month ahead. Yes, it's fun to be spontaneous in Paris, but this is an event to pre-plan. You enter elevators by timeline and whether rebooked or same day. I went straight to the top and worked my way down. The elevators are jam packed, so don't expect great views on the way up unless you snag a window location. I found the food court disappointing, and the souvenirs are the same as on ground. But this is an attraction you have to do once. However, also heed all the pickpocket warnings. The police were out in full force, but between chasing off unlicensed street vendors (guys walk around trying to sell you stuff) and questioning French groups of teens (pickpockets grab your stuff, then hand off and hand off so you'll never catch who actually grabbed your phone) they can't really catch the guys in action. I was a single woman traveling alone, and I was fine. This is not to scare you, but I saw at least three pickpockets in action. Sadly, it is mostly people making themselves targets. I kept a money belt under my clothes, a very sturdy cross body bag with the zipper under my hand or/and under my jacket. I never put my phone in a pocket. If not in use it got zipped in my bag. But mind your zipper! What I witnessed were kids sitting down next to a Man who put his phone next to him to tie his shoe...we alerted him and the kid just looked perplexed. I also saw a sweet little lady with her cross body open and slung behind her back. As teens checked her out, a guard alerted her. So, it's common sense. Don't look like a victim and they'll move on to an easier target.

Make sure you look at the tower from both sides, specially if you want to take good pictures of it. Also, go and see the tower at night too when all lit and see the blinking/dancing lights at the top of the hours for 5 minutes. It is fun. This time we did not walk up the tower, but last time did. The elevators make life easy, but there are long waiting lines. So we walked up all the way to the top to the point you can walk and saw a beautiful top view of Paris. If you are in the mood, you can take the elevator and go to the Eiffel Tower restaurant and have a bite. The luncheon menu is more reasonable in price than the dinner menu, of course. If you really want to take some exceptional pictures, you can walk around the tower and take pictures from some of the surrounding streets. Make sure you take a close look at the tower lower supports and see all the workmanship and details that went into this marvelous structure. Finally, when you are in the Eiffel tower neighborhood, walk to the Pont de Bir-Hakeim Bridge, that was shown in the movie Inception. It is very close. It is an outstanding bridge. Don't miss it.

Other reviews said it is possible to by tickets on the 2nd level to ascend up to the tippy top. That is no longer true; the signs that had previously said biy tix to the top here were covered with black tape, so it is probably a recent change. But we were extremely pleased with the 2nd level.

It is great from afar and even better up close! The line for the lifts to take you to the 1st, 2nd and top floors are ridiculously long. Unless you do not fancy a late start, then by all means, go early and queue up. It will cost you something like 17 Euros, and you can buy the tickets online which might save you a bit of time spent it the queues. Or you can save a few euros, endure a much shorter queue, and work up a bit of sweat by taking the stairs to the 1st and 2nd floors. This will cost you 5 Euros and burn some calories that you can later expend on crêpes. Of course it'll be a lot less crowded in the morning, so schedule your visit accordingly. From the 2nd floor, pay a 6 euro fee to take the lift to the top. Yes, you must see it but we actually enjoyed the views from the 1st and 2nd floor much better. Perhaps it was the amount of people jammed into such a tiny space which takes away from the romance and leisurely feel of checking out this great city. Listen to the Rick Steves podcast on the inception of the tower and its little quirks. Some people even pack their lunches so they don't spend money at the cafe = plan ahead. If you'd rather just admire the tower from the park, yes, you can. But wait, not done yet! Passing on a tip that we got from a lovely Brazilian tourist: make your way to Trocadero metro station at night to catch the Eiffel Tower sparkle. I've been told it starts at 8 pm on the hour. I went at 10 pm so I can't verify the starting time. My, it was beautiful and so very worth it. Enjoy! ","title":"It's only THE Eiffel Tower "}

This time I had the opportunity to travel with my family; my wife, and three Sons, 15, 12 and 9 years old. What an experience!. Paris is a beautiful city as you can read from other forums, with the Eiffel tower as its most famous landmark. We traveled there on August so the place was extremely crowded. I tried to purchase tickets for the Eiffel tower well in advance (about 4-5 months) with no luck. So a little bit disappointed and hearing terror stories of hours waiting in line, my wife and I decided to wait and see. Worst case I would have to purchase a river cruise which included a visit to the Eiffel tower for about 50 EUR per person (not that I had the budget for that). Once in Paris we decided to test our luck and started from the hotel at around 8:30am; we took the very convenient metro line to trocadero station (nice picture perfect spot from here), and walked across to the ticket office right underneath the tower. Let me tell you: yes, the place was crowded, and yes, there is people trying to sell you all sorts of souvenirs and stuff (I confess we reluctantly bought a selfie stick for 7 EUR which ended up being super convenient). Yes, we had to get on-line for about an hour (which is not that bad when you think about how long you need to wait on-line at sixflags for a ride that lasts a minute). The reality is that waiting in-line, right underneath the Eiffel tower, with the diversity of the world passing right by you, is part of the experience! My Kids, who are not the most patient were mesmerized by just being there, under the Eiffel tower, waiting, taking pictures. Do not let the comments on other forums discourage you from trying the line, save yourself good $$$, go early, prepare yourself for the beauty and magnitude of the place and enjoy the wait –underneath the Eiffel tower! - Just make it part of the experience and enjoy!","title":"Waiting inline to go up the Eiffel tower.

On our 3rd visit we queued and went in. The views are amazing but the queues are busy and a lot of people pushing. Once you are in you need to queue again to get to the top. The views are breathtaking but the queues are long. If you have done it before dont do it again fine something else to do in Paris :) On a side note at night every hour on the hour for 5 mins the tower lights up and does a kind of twinkle light show. that IS amazing and worth waiting for at night.

You can also walk up or down from the first and second levels. We decided to take the lift up and walk down just to experience it and were glad we did. You can just see the tower from a different angle. Another surprise and a welcome one, is that they seem to have cleared away the majority of the street sellers who use to be at the base of the tower, makes it a much more pleasant experience not being hounded to buy things constantly.","title":"A must do when visiting Paris.

If you would ask if it's crowed? Yes of course, because the space up there is limited. I always would suggest, take the stairs. You see much more of how they build the structure, it's cheaper and you line up quicker, because the most want to use the elevators. From the 2nd floor you have to take another elevator anyway because the stairs end there. But you can buy a combine ticket for about 12 Euros which is worth it.

It turned out that the south pier is for stairs only and the queue was moving much quicker so we went and joined that. There were signs by each leg to say if they were lift or stairs but these weren't readily apparent with so many people around so better information on site wouldn't go amiss. I was impressed though with the price charged of 5 Euros for an adult and 4 for a youth to go up to level 2 which I thought was good value for a major tourist attraction.

We wanted to actually go inside the Eiffel Tower and see the sunset from the top. Several months before our visit, I went to the website and there wasn't a single time available during our 3-day visit which was during the height of the tourist season. So I then looked into tours with third parties and found a \"sunset\" tour with a guide and \"front of the line\" entry. Although it was considerably more expensive than just buying the admission directly from the Eiffel Tower site, it was worth it. We had a knowledgeable guide who knew exactly where to go, gave lots of helpful commentary and led our group of about 20 people up both levels to see the awesome views. Luckily we had a beautiful day with clear skies and a fabulous sunset - it was very crowded, but I managed to work my way to the front and got some great sunset photos. I'm so glad we weren't able to just buy the admission tickets on our own - the structure is huge and I wouldn't have had any idea which entrance to go to, there were long lines to get in which we passed, and generally it was worth the extra money to have someone lead us to exactly where we needed to be and provide commentary and guidance throughout the whole visit.","title":"Beautiful"}

The queues to go up the tower are horrendous as there are only lifts operating on two of the four legs, with the third being a walking staircase only and the fourth being totally out of commission for any access. In addition it is also worth paying attention to the waiting time from the 2nd floor to the top, that is displayed on the electronic information boards that are clearly visible from the queues. Despite arriving at the opening time of 9-30am it was a 90 minute wait to buy a ticket and get into the lift that takes you directly to the 2nd floor. We were informed that it was not unusual to have a 45 minute wait to take the next lift up to the very top from the 2nd floor. Needless to say the views are spectacular and on a good day you can have panoramic views all over Paris, being easy to pick out well known landmarks like Notre Dame cathedral and the dome of the Sacre Coeur. Access to the 1st floor is only possible on the descent from the 2nd floor and contains the infamous glass walkways which are not for the faint hearted. Also on this floor is a small cafeteria selling snacks and sandwiches and the main formal restaurant, which charges around a 100 euros + per person for dinner. Your only concession for dining in Alain Soulards 58 Tour Eiffel restaurant is that you do not have to queue to get up there and your entrance fee to the Eiffel Tower is free.

There are two stopping points, each with a cafe and walk around area. The views are dramatic and worth all the effort. I word a warning. The gypsies are in mass at this attraction because it brings so many tourist. Young woman or children may approach you and ask, \"do you speak english?\" Then they ask you to read something for them. It is their sad story, written to pull at the heart strings but while you are reading, others are picking your pocket. Try to avoid the gypsies because they have mastered the area and I have seen children used to steal purses, cameras, etc and disappear through the crowd with help of their group.

We stayed close by so saw the tower light up at night. At 10pm the tower sparkles for 5 minutes with hundreds of white lights. This is then repeated every hour. Definitely not to be missed.","title":"Worth the visit!"}

The lines for the ride stay long but that said, it means that anyone is able to go up and see this amazing city from the top of the Eiffel Tower. At night the Eiffel Tower can be seen from some distance away with it being lighted. One the hour in the evening, the lights twinkle. That is so beautiful! I did not find the cost of either rids to the top to be expensive. If you want to eat at the restaurant one must make a reservation. We were not aware and the wait was three hours.

The key is to simply concentrate on one step at a time, breathing and counting, and look down at the steps, not at the sights as you are climbing. Once you get to the first and second levels, you can look at the fantastic views, but not while climbing the steps. I also found that not looking up while waiting in the line before the climb was very helpful. I'm sure this sounds foolish, but I wore a baseball-type hat, which allowed me to wait in line under the Tower and not see the looming structure overhead that would have made me extremely nervous. Again, these are tips for those with a fear of heights. Take plenty of time to take in the views, but not while waiting in line or climbing.

Not for the faint hearted as it is several hundred steps up and then down again and it is a spiral staircase going up the inside of the tower. But having said that the views are incredible. The second floor has a new glass floor area which is great for looking down and also has a new seating area made from recycled materials. The ice cream is excelent and it was lovely to sit, eat and look out over Paris. The film about the Eiffel Tower is excellent and shows a great perspective of the firework displays. If you don't mind the queues it is worth going to the top but as a nice alternative we chose to re-visit at dusk. We sat at the bottom in a lovely park and had a picnic, when the sun goes down the tower lights up which is beautiful in itself. The most special part came when it got to 10pm and for five minutes the tower sparkles with huge fiary lights. It does this on the hour until the tower closes so is well worth waiting for.","title":"Amazing views and worth a visit at night time too!"}

We took the cable car/lift down! It only cost 5 Euros each and was well worth it,and only waited in queue for approx 20 mins which was good considering it was height of summer. On a Saturday during summer they have a small market in the Park grounds selling speciality products, food , souvenirs and even a roller skating rink!

{"bubbleCount":50,"createdAt":"August 9, 2015","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"Going up the Eiffel Tower is a must when visiting Paris. I also suggest pre-booking in advance. This will save you time and queuing. The queues are horrendous and if it's in hot sunshine there is no shade. It is also worthwhile using a company for a guided tour. This means that the guide will walk you to the tower and give you a great history lesson about the tower and Paris itself. You take the lift from the foot of the tower to the second floor. On this level is the restaurant and you have your first opportunity to view Paris. You can walk round the tower and view the City from North, South, East and West. It also on this floor where you take the lift to the top of the tower. No visit to the tower is complete without going right to the top. When you reach the top you can stay inside and still enjoy the views but it is much better to walk up those final few steps and go outside to get that WOW..!! And while you are up there why not have a glass of champagne. The descent down is easy. Lift back down to the second floor. Then you can either walk down the stairs or again take the lift. At the Bottom... Beware of the street sellers trying to sell their wares who are very persistent.","title":"Book in Advance, jump the queue..."}

{"bubbleCount":40,"createdAt":"August 9, 2015","query":"Eiffel_Tower","text":"We joined the queue at about 11:15PM and got to the front at about midnight so I imagine earlier in the day you would be queuing for quite a while so I'd advise having a drink and snacks in your bag. It was gorgeous seeing the tower lit and sparkling whilst we were stood under it. You will want to wear comfortable shoes and have adequate amounts of water with you if you're going to walk all the way, or be prepared to buy drinks when you get up. It was pretty strenuous to walk so if you have any health problems or a lower fitness level, either take it slow or think about getting the lift if possible. My boyfriend and I are healthy, gym-going 22 and 30 year olds and were still exhausted and out of breath after each level. We didn't make it all the way to the very top as access to this closes after a certain time but we still got gorgeous night views of the city from the two levels we did get to. I'd advise leaving 1.5-2 hours free for actually doing the tower and however long the queue is at the time. We forgot to take water and bought it on the first level and it was pretty pricey so plan ahead and take some up. The gift shop was very expensive and honestly didn't have anything worth buying in my opinion. If you have children with you, be warned there are very overpriced Disney toys in the shop that have nothing to do with the Eiffel Tower itself so you may not want your child to see them. The inner corners on level 1 are clear so be prepared to walk over them and see all the way down or try to avoid if you think this would scare you.","title":"Great to visit if short wait time"}

In fact, there was no availability for the entire month so it would seem advisable to search for tickets as soon as you know when you are going.

The tickets for our kids (16 and 20) were €2 less on presentation of EU ID for those aged from 16 to 24. If you can, walk up as it will help you appreciate the incredible structure but as the lift has glass sides, it still allows you to appreciate the ascent. Seeing the hourly light show when it gets dark is a lovely way to end the visit. From the top, it took as about 30 minutes to descend using the two lifts and to get to a good vantage point on the Champs du Mar to view the spectacle.

Breathtaking!","title":"Remarkable landmark!"}

Over all it was a great experience except for the line up for tickets, bearing in mind it was 37 degrees there was no shade and the water must spray was in completed the wrong position to provide any relief. I felt for the families with older people and young kids. If the weather is warm I'd advise on a hat and plenty of water.","title":"Tour me Eiffel"}

Make sure you buy a skim the line ticket with access to the very top where Mr Eiffel had a tiny apartment that Thomas Edison visited. The view is spectacular. Be patient, you will have to line up to take the elevator to the top level. There seemed to be less people around 5 PM.","title":"Go to the very top!"}
